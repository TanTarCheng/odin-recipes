    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    <p>We fixed the chicken burger, and all it really took was stirring in a couple spoons of chimichurri sauce. No longer sort of dry and kind of boring, this is one of the best burgers you'll ever have.</p>
    <p>If you showed up at a cookout where you heard they were making burgers, but once you got there you realized they were talking about chicken burgers, would you be excited or profoundly disappointed? That’s what I thought. Me too. When your mouth is ready for juicy and flavorful, something dry and bland just won’t do, which is why I was so thrilled with how these chimichurri chicken burgers turned out. They weren’t just comparable, but maybe even…better? Okay, that might be a stretch, but the fact that I was even having those thoughts is a great indication of just how much I enjoyed these. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <div><ul><p><b>Chimichurri Sauce:</b></p>
        <li>1/2 cup Italian parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul></div>
    <p></p>
    <div><ol><p><b>Direction:</b></p>
        <li><p><b>Step 1:</b>
            To make chimichurri, chop herbs with a sharp knife until fine; add sliced garlic to the mixture. Continue chopping until mixture is very fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, the 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 2:</b>
            To make burgers, place chicken thighs in the freezer until firm and half-frozen, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 3:</b>
            Place thighs on a cutting board, and using a large sharp knife or heavy cleaver, chop until it resembles coarsely ground meat. (Alternatively, place chicken in a food processor; pulse on and off, scraping sides often, until texture resembles coarsely ground meat.)</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 4 :</b>
            Transfer chicken to a bowl, add the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 cup chimichurri sauce. Use a fork to mix thoroughly.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 5 :</b>
            Using damp hands, form chicken mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 6 :</b>
            Stir together mayonnaise and  remaining chimichurri sauce to make spread for buns; refrigerate until needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 7 :</b>
            Remove burgers from the fridge; sprinkle both sides with breadcrumbs.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 8 :</b>
            Add olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and set over medium high heat. When hot, but before oil starts smoking, add burgers, and cook about 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Step 9 :</b>
            Let burgers rest for a minute or two. Serve on buns spread with chimichurri mayo and the fixings of your choice.</p>
        </li>
